# What Time Today (WTT)

> Simple tool to share your availability as plain text. Select time slots, convert timezones, copy and send. No calendar links needed.

## About

WTT is a mobile-first web app for quickly sharing when you're available. Instead of sending Calendly links or creating Doodle polls, select your free time slots and copy formatted text to paste anywhere.

## The Problem WTT Solves

When someone asks "when are you free?", you have options:
1. Send a Calendly/Cal.com booking link (overkill for friends/coworkers)
2. Create a When2Meet/Doodle poll (overkill for 1-on-1)
3. Type it out manually (tedious for multiple slots + timezones)

WTT is option 4: Select times visually, copy as text, paste anywhere.

## Output Example

```
I'm available:
Monday, Feb 10: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
Tuesday, Feb 11: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
Thursday, Feb 13: 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM
(EST - convert to your timezone)
```
